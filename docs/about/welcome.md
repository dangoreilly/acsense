# Welcome
Acsense is an open-source product of the [TCD Sense Map project](https://www.tcd.ie/disability/services/tcdsense.php) at Trinity College Dublin. It is a web-based application that allows users to create and manage their own maps, with a focus on accessibility and inclusivity.

## Features
- **Create and manage maps**: Users can create their own maps, add locations, and manage them easily.
- **Manage building information**: Display information about campus buildings, such as opening times. Add gallery photos so users can see inside buildings before they get there.
- **Accessibility information**: Add accessibility information to locations, such as wheelchair access, accessible toilets, and more.
- **Floorplan view**: Users can view maps in a floorplan format, making it easier to navigate large buildings or campuses.
- **Search functionality**: Users can search for locations, buildings, and other information easily.
- **Open-source**: Acsense is [open-source](https://github.com/dangoreilly/acsense), allowing developers to contribute and improve the application, or to self-host on your own servers. It is released under the MIT License, which is a permissive free software license.
